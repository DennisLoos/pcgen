Weapon and Armor Proficiency	KEY:Warsword of Talisid ~ Weapon and Armor Proficiency	CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warsword of Talisid Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:Warsword of Talisid gains no proficiency with any weapon or armor.
Spells Per Day			KEY:Warsword of Talisid ~ Spells Per Day				CATEGORY:Special Ability	TYPE:Warsword of Talisid Class Feature.SpecialQuality			SOURCEPAGE:p.	DESC:A warsword of Talisid continues advancing in spellcasting ability as well as gaining the abilities of her new class. Thus, when a new warsword of Talisid level is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in whatever spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefi t a character of that class would have gained (improved chance of controlling or rebuking undead, wild shape ability, and so on). This essentially means that she adds the level of divine oracle to the level of whatever other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day accordingly. For example, if Cassandra, a 10th-level cleric, gains a level as a warsword of Talisid, she gains new spells as if she had risen to 11th level as a cleric, but uses the other warsword of Talisid aspects of level progression such as base attack bonus and save bonuses. If she next gains a level as a cleric, making her an 11th-level cleric/1st-level warsword of Talisid, she gains spells as if she had risen to 12th level as a cleric. If a character had more than one divine spellcasting class before she became a warsword of Talisid, the player must decide which class to assign each level of warsword of Talisid for the purpose of determining spells per day and spells known.
